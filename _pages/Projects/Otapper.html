                <p>O'Tapper is a clone of the original Tapper that was found in Arcades, and Bars across America. I created this project on my own as a part of the classic game project for my game programming and development class.</p>

                <h4 class="white small centered">Project Overview</h4>
                <p class="white indented-text">This project posed a couple of unique problems that I couldn't easily get help on. Primarily was the movement system, instead of being able to use a gravity based or standard grid system I created a series of points that the player was locked on the X axis to. Additionally ensuring the ways the player moved up and down, and snapped back to the keg when pouring beer were movements I had to take into account.</p>
                <p class="white indented-text">Another mechanic I would like to highlight is the instantiation, and destruction of the beer and glass objects (represented by cream and neon green rectangles). In working on this mechanic I also learned about, and used co-routines. I then continued to use co-routines throghout the project in the patrons, start screens, and event system.</p>

                <h4 class="blue small centered">The Burndown Chart</h4>
                <p class="indented-text">As a part of this project I was introduced to a burndown chart and scrum. I really enjoyed the way these tools help me stay on track and think they are a valuble asset to production timelines, and am excited ot use them in the future. </p>

                <h4 class="black small centered">Where I Succeeded</h4>
                <p class="centered">This project helped me learn a lot more about a production timline. I had to use burndown charts, and scrums in order to keep myself on track. I also learned a lot more about coding for unity in 2D.</p>

            <div class="project-textblock right">
                <h4 class="black small centered centered">Where I Can Improve</h4>
                <p class="centered">I hope in the future to be able to implement sprites and animations from the original game. From the start I began with the understanding that I would likely not treat art as a priority as it was for a coding class, but being able to code an animation switcher is an important skill to have. </p>
