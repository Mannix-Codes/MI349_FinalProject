                <p>I began working on this website as a replacement for my previous portfolio website. I had previously used adobe to make a portfolio website, but I wanted to create a more interactive and modern experience using web technologies.</p>

                <h4 class="white small centered">Design</h4>
                <p class="white indented-text">The concept for the overall aesthetic and design of this sate came to fruition during the first assignment of a web design class at MSU. I wanted to choose a bright color scheme and retro/comic aesthetic. I had been wanting to re-vamp my portfiolio site, and decided to use this assignment as an opportunity begin that process. I also got to work more with vectors and logo design, as both the site logo and fire frame were created by me.</p>

                <h4 class="blue small centered">HTML, CSS, The Whole Enchilada</h4>
                <p class="indented-text">While I had an introductory level knowledge of html and css before starting this project, I was able to expand my skills significantly. I learned about responsive design, semantic HTML, and advanced CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and functional website. One technique I will be using much more in the future is the css grid which is demonstrated best on the projects page</p>
