                <p>Cyberhazard is the game me and the members of team DuckDuckGo created for the spartasoft September 2024 GameJam. I was a programmer and audio designer for my team</p>

                <p class="white indented-text">The Player Controller
                The player controller for cyberhazard posed a unique challenge. As opposed to a standard player controller that works with a gravity source I needed to create a controller that works in zero gravity. Initially I used the WASD key bindings to manually move the player which worked, however it didn't feel as smooth or realistic as the team liked. This lead me to shift to a momentum based movement system.</p>
                <p class="white indented-text">With the newer system even if a player releases a key they continue to follow the path that their momentum would take. Additionally the force applied to the player now gradually increases to give the effect of a player speeding up and slowing down. To ensure that players cannot go infinitely faster I also implemented a terminal velocity. When it came to implementing up/down movement the strategy was similar to WASD, I just mapped a similar axis to the Shift, and Spacebar Keys.</p>
                <p class="white indented-text">The team also wanted to implement a rolling mechanic to allow the player to re-orient themselves. For this in stead of the standard movement method I used the same method that I used for the camera movement. Rather than basing it off of values from the mouse position I used the Q and E buttons to allow for rolling.</p>

                <h4 class="black small centered">UI Design</h4>
                <p class="black indented-text"> On this project I was in charge of designing and implementing all of the UI, but I would like to highlight the Heads Up Display (HUD). I designed the HUD with information that's useful to the player while not providing too much information, and remaining dynamic. Working with the UI gave me a better understanding of unity's canvas system and how to code with it in general. The HUD can be seen in the gameplay video above. </p>

                <h4 class="black small centered">Where I Succeeded</h4>
                <p class="centered">This project taught me a lot about working in a team, using version control and pushing code. My team was very good at helping each other out to get the desired outcome and create the game we made.</p>

                <h4 class="black small centered centered">Where I Can Improve</h4>
                <p class="centered">In future projects I hope I am able to take a larger role in the team, I was relatively new to programming C# when working on the project, so I was unable to do as much as I would've liked.</p>
