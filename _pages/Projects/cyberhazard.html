                <p class="white-text indented-text">The Player Controller
                The player controller for cyberhazard posed a unique challenge. As opposed to a standard player controller that works with a gravity source I needed to create a controller that works in zero gravity. Initially I used the WASD key bindings to manually move the player which worked, however it didn't feel as smooth or realistic as the team liked. This lead me to shift to a momentum based movement system.</p>
                <p class="white-text indented-text">With the newer system even if a player releases a key they continue to follow the path that their momentum would take. Additionally the force applied to the player now gradually increases to give the effect of a player speeding up and slowing down. To ensure that players cannot go infinitely faster I also implemented a terminal velocity. When it came to implementing up/down movement the strategy was similar to WASD, I just mapped a similar axis to the Shift, and Spacebar Keys.</p>
                <p class="white-text indented-text">The team also wanted to implement a rolling mechanic to allow the player to re-orient themselves. For this in stead of the standard movement method I used the same method that I used for the camera movement. Rather than basing it off of values from the mouse position I used the Q and E buttons to allow for rolling.</p>
