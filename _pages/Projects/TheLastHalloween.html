                <p>The Last Halloween is a game that me and a team of other students developed as a part of the MSU Game Design and development minor. I was the project manager for my team, but filled in programming in some areas</p>

                <p class="white indented-text">This game was not my first experience working in a team, however it has been the longest I've worked on a team project. Not only that it was my first experience being a project manager. As a project manager I was in charge of organizing sprints, delegating tasks, and ensuring that the team was on track to complete the game within the two month time limit. This experience taught me a lot about leadership and communication within a team setting. I also learned a great deal about scope and time management, as well as the agile development process</p>

                <p class="indented-text">This project taught me the value of being a versatile team memner, especially when in a producer role. Due to the small nature of our team and the limited time we had to complete the project, I had to fill in wherever I was needed. This included programming, designing, and testing when our leads were focusing on more important features. Namely I created the mini-map and summary page UI while our programmer and designers were pre-occupied</p>

                <h4 class="black small centered">Where We Succeeded</h4>
                <p class="centered">Our team was able to develop a functional game within the time constraints, effectively collaborate using version control, and implement some highly technical features such as our fully procedurally generated levels.</p>

                <h4 class="black small centered centered">Where I Can Improve</h4>
                <p class="centered">We had to cut a lot of features, and ran out of scope a lot quicker than expected. In future projects I'll focus on being more reasonable when planning, and managing scope more effectively.</p>
