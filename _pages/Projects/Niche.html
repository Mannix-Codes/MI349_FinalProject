                <p>"Niche" is a student run game show that I created with Aiden Myerson for the student organization Telecasters, I developed the software, and continue to develop episodes as a producer</p>

                <p class="indented-text">Unlike most other decades-old shows within Telecasters, Niche is brand new. This meant me and Aiden had take the concept from pitching in executive board meetings, to producing, and finally releasing episodes to the public. For this process I had to write a treatment, create slides, and develop the software to run the show. I also had to learn how to manage a television studio, with a live audience a host and contestants in a format that doesn't allow for multiple takes. To the right you can see the pitch presentation I created for the show </p>

                <h4 class="white small centered">Production Cycles</h4>
                <p class="white indented-text">Unlike most of my other project Niche follows a 3 week production cycle, with each week dedicated to a different stage of production. This includes pre-production, production, and post-production. Each stage has its own set of tasks and deliverables, and requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that the show is completed on time and to a high standard. While the iterative design process has similarities, the turnaround on a television show is much faster and requires more immediate problem-solving.</p>

                <p class="centered">I was able to successfully pitch, produce, and release a new show within a student organization. I developed the software, managed the production cycle, and coordinated with the team to ensure each episode was completed on time and to a high standard.</p>

                <p class="centered">The show is still in production, and I am continuously learning how to better manage the production cycle, coordinate with the team, and improve the software to enhance the overall quality of the show. Additionally the team and I focus on how to challenge the format and create new and interesting episodes.</p>
